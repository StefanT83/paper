#Introduction
We present  aircraft  measurements of BBOA over West  Africa

Particle size was measured using PCASP (Bloggset al 2004).

Jones et al (1988) conducted several studies in this region.
Put continental-scale measurements have't previously been made.

A large uncetainty in modelng BBOA is the extent in which measurement in the literature can be applied at a regional scale.
